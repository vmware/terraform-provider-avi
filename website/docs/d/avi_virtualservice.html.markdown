# avi_virtualservice

This data source is used to to get avi_virtualservice objects.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "avi_virtualservice" "foo_virtualservice" {
    uuid = "virtualservice-f9cf6b3e-a411-436f-95e2-2982ba2b217b"
    name = "foo"
    cloud_ref = "/api/cloud/?tenant=admin&name=Default-Cloud"
  }
```
